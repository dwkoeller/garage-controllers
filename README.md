# ESPHome Garage Controller (Single & Double Door)

This project is a **complete ESPHome replacement** for the original Arduino-based garage door controller firmware.
It supports **both single** and **double** garage door setups, using a single YAML file with `substitutions` to switch between configurations.

---

## üöÄ Features
- **Single or Double Door Support** ‚Äì set in `substitutions`.
- **Direct Home Assistant API Integration** ‚Äì no MQTT broker required.
- **Temperature Offset** ‚Äì matches original Arduino (-0.5¬∞C for single, +0.5¬∞C for double).
- **BME280 Sensor** ‚Äì temperature, humidity, and pressure readings.
- **Light Level Detection** ‚Äì via ADC input (0‚Äì100% scaled).
- **Motion-Triggered Garage Light** ‚Äì light turns on when motion detected below brightness threshold; auto-off after 30s.
- **Relay-Controlled Garage Door** ‚Äì active LOW, 600ms pulse for open/close/stop.
- **Door Open/Closed Sensors** ‚Äì reed switches with combined door state sensor.
- **External Hardware Watchdog Support** ‚Äì pulses GPIO0 to keep external watchdog happy.
  - Fast heartbeat during boot
  - Normal heartbeat when running
  - Fast heartbeat during Wi-Fi reconnects
- **Wi-Fi Status Feedback** ‚Äì blinks garage light on connect.
- **Online Status Binary Sensor** ‚Äì shows if controller is connected to HA.
- **Uptime Sensor** ‚Äì reports in hours since last reboot.
- **Manual Restart Button** ‚Äì restart ESP from HA.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Substitutions

You can easily switch between single and double door by changing:

```yaml
substitutions:
  garage_type: "single"          # "single" or "double"
  garage_name: "Garage Single"   # Friendly name
  temp_offset: "-0.5"            # "-0.5" for single, "0.5" for double
  light_on_threshold: "75"       # Light % below which motion triggers light
```

---

## üì¶ Included Files
- `garage-single.yaml` ‚Äì ready to flash for single-door setup.
- `garage-double.yaml` ‚Äì ready to flash for double-door setup.

---

## üîÑ Behavior Summary
- Door relay pulses for 600ms on open/close/stop commands.
- Light turns on when motion detected if brightness < `light_on_threshold`.
- Light turns off after 30 seconds with no motion.
- External watchdog pin pulses to prevent reset unless firmware stops responding.
- Garage light blinks briefly when Wi-Fi connects.
- Binary sensor shows online/offline status in Home Assistant.
- Uptime (in hours) resets after watchdog or manual restart.

## üñ• How to Flash
1. Copy the YAML file (`garage-single.yaml` or `garage-double.yaml`) into your ESPHome configuration folder.
2. Update `YOUR_WIFI`, `YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD`, and `YOUR_API_KEY` in the YAML.
3. From ESPHome Dashboard, click **Install** and flash your ESP8266.
4. Add the device to Home Assistant via ESPHome integration.
